Load project index into session memory

Please run the loader script to load project-index-compact.json into the assistant's session memory before starting a coding session.

Suggested instruction to paste to the assistant at session start:

"Assistant, please load the project index from `project-index-compact.json`. Use it as the authoritative workspace index for this session and reference file summaries when answering questions."
